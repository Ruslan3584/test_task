# Object Localization

## Overview

My goal is to find the target in the camera frame.

## Project Structure 

The project is organized into modular components for image processing:


- **utils/**
  - `__init__.py`
  - `image_processing.py`: Module for image processing functions.
- `main.py`: Entry point of the application orchestrating the image processing and visualization.

- **images/**: Directory for storing target and frame images.

- **.gitignore**: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.

- **README.md**: Documentation providing information about the project, its usage and installation.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd test_task`
3. Install dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the main script: `python3 main.py`
